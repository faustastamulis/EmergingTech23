# Emerging Technologies Assessment 2023
This is my Github Repository to the assessment that I must complete for the 2023 Emerging Technologies module. My name is Faustas Tamulis (G00373028@atu.ie).
I am a final year full-time student at ATU(Atlantic Technological University).
The topics covered in this assessment are as follows:
*  Qiskit
*  Deutsch Algorithm

## Qiskit
IBM created the open-source software framework known as Qiskit to allow people to interact with quantum computers. It is a complete toolkit for developing quantum computers that offers a variety of software, libraries, and programming tools for creating and running quantum algorithms.

Qiskit offers a high-level programming interface that enables users to communicate with quantum processors and simulators. Python, which is the primary language used for quantum programming in Qiskit, is one of the many programming languages it supports. This makes it available to a variety of users, both experienced quantum computer users and beginners.

Users may pick and choose from a variety of components to tailor the framework to their needs because it is intended to be modular. The four primary parts are as follows:

1. Qiskit Terra: This component provides the foundational building blocks for quantum programming. It includes tools for creating quantum circuits, manipulating quantum gates, and performing quantum operations.
    
2. Qiskit Aer: Aer is a high-performance simulator that allows users to simulate the behavior of quantum circuits on classical computers. It provides different types of simulators, including state vector simulators, unitary simulators, and noise simulators.

3. Qiskit Aqua: Aqua is a library within Qiskit that focuses on quantum applications beyond basic quantum circuits. It provides a collection of high-level quantum algorithms and tools for solving problems in optimization, chemistry, finance, and more.

4. Qiskit Ignis: Ignis is a module for characterizing and mitigating errors in quantum systems. It includes tools for calibrating quantum devices, measuring and mitigating noise, and benchmarking the performance of quantum systems.

IBM Quantum, the company's cloud-based quantum computing platform, is also accessible through Qiskit. The IBM Quantum Experience offers both simulators and actual quantum computers for users to execute their programmes on.
